# SQL & SQIL

the implement of soft Q learning algorithm in pytorch

**note that this is for discrete action space**

**update SQIL: soft q imitation learning**

all code is in one file and easily to follow

## requirment

- tensorboardX (for logging, you can delete the logging code if you don't need)
- pytorch (>= 1.0, 1.0.1 used in my experiment)
- gym

in Cartpole-v0
